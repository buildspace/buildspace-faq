# No default signer found
Why is this happening?

This happens because the you do not have any account set as default to sign the transaction.

âœ… Solution 
Run this command in your terminal and this will update your config file to set a default signer for your project.
```
solana config set --keypair ~/.config/solana/devnet.json
```
