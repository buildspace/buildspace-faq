# Call revert exception

## Why is this happening?

<ol>
    <li>Your metamask wallet is not connected to the correct network</li>
    <li>Your contract is not deployed</li>
    <li>You did not update your ABI after deploying your contract</li>
    <li>You did not implement this function in your smart contract</li>
</ol>

## Solutions

<ol>
    <li>
        Make sure you're connected to the correct network your smart contract is deployed to. If your contract is deployed to Rinkeby, make sure you're connected to the Rinkeby network.
    </li>
    <li>Deploy by running `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby`</li>
    <li>Make sure to update your ABI to the latest version after deploying your smart contract</li>
    <li>Do remember to save your changes in your smart contract before deploying</li>
</ol>
