# Many vulnerabilities when installing Hardhat

## Why is this happening?

<span>
    This happens because most of the dependencies hardhat used is depenedent on other packages that might be vulnerable. You can simply ignore it as you only need hardhat to help you with compiling and deploying your smart contract and will not be needed in your production environment. However, if you want to fix this issue, you're free to submit a PR [here](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat).
