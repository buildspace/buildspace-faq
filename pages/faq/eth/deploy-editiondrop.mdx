# Failed to deploy editionDrop

## Why is this happening?

<span>
  There are various reasons why this can happen.
</span>

<ol>
    <li>You did not initialize your app in your [ThirdWeb Dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard)</li>
    <li>Your firewall is blocking access to ThirdWeb's IPFS</li>
</ol>

## Solution
You need to initialise your ThirdWebSDK by using cloudflare's IPFS. Special thanks to @piperalpha for this solution:

```js
const sdk = new ThirdwebSDK(wallet, {}, new IpfsStorage("https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/"));
```
