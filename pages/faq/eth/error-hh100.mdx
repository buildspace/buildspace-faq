# Network rinkeby doesn’t exist

## Why is this happening?

<span>
  This is usually caused by not having a rinkeby network in your `hardhat.config.js`.
</span>

## Solution

<span>
  Make sure your `hardhat.config.js` looks like this and also do save your changes before running any commands.
</span>

```js
// hardhat.config.js
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle");
require("dotenv").config();

// This is a sample Hardhat task. To learn how to create your own go to
// https://hardhat.org/guides/create-task.html
task("accounts", "Prints the list of accounts", async (taskArgs, hre) => {
    const accounts = await hre.ethers.getSigners();

    for (const account of accounts) {
        console.log(account.address);
    }
});

module.exports = {
    solidity: "0.8.0",
    networks: {
        rinkeby: {
            url: process.env.ALCHEMY_KEY,
            accounts: [process.env.ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY],
        },
    },
};
```
