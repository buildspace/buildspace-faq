# OpenSea not showing my NFTs

## Why is this happening?

<span>
  There are various reasons why this can happen.
</span>

<ol>
    <li>
        Your image URL is invalid. It needs to have the image extension at the end of the URL to be considered as an image. For example, here's how it might look if you were to use imgur as your image host. `https://i.imgur.com/Qm3U6wd_d.webp`
    </li>
    <li>Your metadata is not refreshed automatically by OpenSea</li>
</ol>

## Solution

<span>
  There are 2 ways to solving this.
</span>

<ol>
    <li>Fix your image URL and re-deploy your contract</li>
    <li>Click on the `refresh metadata` button at the top right corner of your NFT page in OpenSea</li>
</ol>
