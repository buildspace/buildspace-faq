# Unrecognized signer source for Anchor build

## Error
```
error: Invalid value for '--program-id <PROGRAM_ID>': unrecognized signer source
There was a problem deploying: Output { status: ExitStatus(ExitStatus(256)), stdout: "", stderr: "" }.
```

## Why is this happening?

<span>
  This happens because the path of your project contains spaces.
</span>

<Callout emoji="✅">
  Either replace those spaces with some character or delete them.
</Callout>

<Callout emoji="❌">
  If you append ```--program-id <your-program-id>``` to the command, deploy will "succeed" but then on Solana Explorer no contract is found.
