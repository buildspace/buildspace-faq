# Too few Xs in template "solana-install-init"

## Why is this happening?

<span>
This happens because your version of Linux does not currently support the mktemp installation command or that solana-init config doesn't currently support your linux version.

## Solution
If you are on Ubuntu or using Ubuntu on WSL, make sure you are using version 20.04 or 22.04.
