# Frequently Asked Questions

This page contains all frequently asked questions with regards to the issues that users experience when working on the project on buildspace.

## Unpredictable Gas Limit

**What is Gas Limit?**

<span>
    Gas limit refers to the maximum amount of gas that you're willing to spend on a particular transaction. This error usually happens when
    you are providing an invalid input when calling a function from your smart contract
</span>

**✅ Solutions**

```javascript
// Add a manual gasLimit
await wavePortalContract.wave("hello", { gasLimit: 300000 });

// Add a dynamic gasLimit
const startEstimate = await wavePortalContract.estimateGas.wave("Hello");
const tx = await wavePortalContract.wave("Hello", {
    gasLimit: startEstimate,
});
```

## Call revert exception

**Why is this happening?**

<ol>
    <li>Your metamask wallet is not connected to the correct network</li>
    <li>Your contract is not deployed</li>
    <li>You did not update your ABI after deploying your contract</li>
    <li>You did not implement this function in your smart contract</li>
</ol>

**✅ Solutions**

<ol>
    <li>
        Make sure you're connected to the correct network your smart contract is deployed to. If your contract is deployed to Rinkeby, make
        sure you're connected to the Rinkeby network
    </li>
    <li>Deploy by running `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby`</li>
    <li>Make sure to update your ABI to the latest version after deploying your smart contract</li>
    <li>Do remember to save your changes in your smart contract before deploying</li>
</ol>

## Many vulnerabilities when installing hardhat

**Why is this happening?**

<span>
    This happens because most of the dependencies hardhat used is depenedent on other packages that might be vulnerable. You can simply
    ignore it as you only need hardhat to help you with compiling and deploying your smart contract and will not be needed in your
    production environment. However, if you want to fix this issue, you're free to submit a PR here
    [hardhat](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat)
</span>

## Timeout error

**Why is this happening?**

<span>This happens when your contract deployment takes too long to deploy or that your RPC endpoint is not responding</span>

**✅ Solution**

<span>You will need to recreate a new Alchemy app from the dashboard and update it in your environment variables</span>

## Error HH100: Network rinkeby doesn’t exist

**Why is this happening?**

<span>This is usually caused by not having a rinkeby network in your `hardhat.config.js`</span>

**✅ Solution**

<span>Make sure your `hardhat.config.js` looks like this and also do save your changes before running any commands</span>

```javascript
// hardhat.config.js
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle");
require("dotenv").config();

// This is a sample Hardhat task. To learn how to create your own go to
// https://hardhat.org/guides/create-task.html
task("accounts", "Prints the list of accounts", async (taskArgs, hre) => {
    const accounts = await hre.ethers.getSigners();

    for (const account of accounts) {
        console.log(account.address);
    }
});

module.exports = {
    solidity: "0.8.0",
    networks: {
        rinkeby: {
            url: process.env.ALCHEMY_KEY,
            accounts: [process.env.ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY],
        },
    },
};
```

## error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported

**Why is this happening?**

<span>This error is usually caused by the library using an unsupported version of Node.</span>

**✅ Solution**

<span>You need to download Node v16.14.2 from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)</span>

## Hardhat menu not showing

**Why is this happening?**

<span>This usually happens when you create a `hardhat.config.js` in your PC drive instead of your project folder.</span>

**✅ Solution**

<ol>
    <li>Go to `C:/Users/[YOUR_USERNAME]` and delete `hardhat.config.js`</li>
    <li>Run `npx hardhat`</li>
</ol>

## Expected private key to be an Uint8Array with length 32

**Why is this happening?**

<span>This happens because you're most probably using your wallet address instead of your private key.</span>

**✅ Solution**

<span>
    You can get your private key by following the guide
    [here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key)
