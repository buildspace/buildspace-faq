# Frequently Asked Questions

This page contains all frequently asked questions for the Solana ecosystem.

## No default signer found

**Why is this happening?**

<span>This happens because the you do not have any account set as default to sign the transaction.</span>

**✅ Solution**
Run this command in your terminal and this will update your config file to set a default signer for your project.

```
solana config set --keypair ~/.config/solana/devnet.json
```

## baseAccount not provided

**Why is this happening?**

<span>
    This happens because you did not specify the correct publicKey to the baseAccount field. Another reason why this can happen is probably
    because you have a typo in your code
</span>

**✅ Solution**
Double check your code and ensure that there are no typos in your code. Here's one example of why you might get an error

```
❌ Code with error
// create an account keypair for our program to use
const baseAcccount = anchor.web3.Keypair.generate();
//call start_stuff_off and pass it the params it needs
const tx = await program.rpc.startStuffOff({
  accounts: {
    baseAcccount: baseAcccount.publicKey,    // This is the typo. It should be baseAccount not baseAcccount
    user: provider.wallet.publicKey,
    SystemProgram: SystemProgram.programId,
  },
  signers: [baseAcccount],
});
```

```
✅ Fix for this
// create an account keypair for our program to use
const baseAccount = anchor.web3.Keypair.generate();

// //call start_stuff_off and pass it the params it needs
const tx = await program.rpc.startStuffOff({
  accounts: {
    baseAccount: baseAccount.publicKey,    // <====== This is the fix.
    user: provider.wallet.publicKey,
    systemProgram: SystemProgram.programId,
  },
  signers: [baseAccount],
});
```
